# Machine Learning - Short Term Rental Rates

This is a personal project to develop a model for predicting the expected daily rate of short term rentals in my area. The model was built with Python, SKlearn, and CSV data dumps from the website, AllTheRooms.com. 

Note that AllTheRooms.com requires a subscription to download their data and therefore the legality of uploading the source data from this project is questionable.
